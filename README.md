# Tumblr Theme engine support in Atom

Forked from Atom's [language-html](https://github.com/atom/language-html) package to include patterns for Tumblr's theme engine.

I may make some rookie mistakes in creating a grammar for Tumblr's theme engine, especially with the regular expressions and how to conventionalise patterns' names. Feel free to help!
