# Tumblr Theme engine support in Atom

~~Forked from Atom's [language-html](https://github.com/atom/language-html) package to include patterns for Tumblr's theme engine.~~

~~I may make some rookie mistakes in creating a grammar for Tumblr's theme engine, especially with the regular expressions and how to conventionalise patterns' names. Feel free to help!~~

This was made when language-html was made as a TextMate grammar. This will be archived to start anew into a Tree-sitter grammar in a new repository.
